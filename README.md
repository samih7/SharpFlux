# SharpFlux

After having wrapped my head around concepts like _unidirectional data flow_, _state containers_ and seen many possible Flux implementations, here is my [lightweight .NET Standard library](https://github.com/samih7/SharpFlux/tree/master/SharpFlux/SharpFlux) enabling a Flux Architecture in .NET applications.

* Used alongside MVVM design pattern in the [Xamarin.Forms TodoApp sample](https://github.com/samih7/SharpFlux/tree/master/SharpFlux/TodoApp).

Inspired by [Facebook Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux/).
