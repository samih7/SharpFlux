# SharpFlux

After having wrapped my head around concepts like _unidirectional data flow_, _state containers_ and seen many possible Flux implementations, here is a [lightweight library](https://github.com/samih7/SharpFlux/tree/master/SharpFlux/SharpFlux) enabling a Flux Architecture in .NET applications. 

Inspired by [Facebook Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux/).

## Samples
[Xamarin.Forms TodoApp](https://github.com/samih7/SharpFlux/tree/master/SharpFlux/TodoApp) (used alongside MVVM design pattern)

## NuGet package
