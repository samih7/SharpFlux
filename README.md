# SharpFlux
[Lightweight library](https://github.com/samih7/SharpFlux/tree/master/SharpFlux/SharpFlux) enabling Flux Architecture in C# .NET applications.

Used alongside MVVM pattern in the [Xamarin.Forms TodoApp sample](https://github.com/samih7/SharpFlux/tree/master/SharpFlux/TodoApp).

Inspired by [Facebook Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux/).
